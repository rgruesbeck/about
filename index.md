# Hello

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a STEM/Biology background and specialize in all things JavaScript. I discovered software while working in the wine industry where I built an ethanol prediction model.

Shortly after, I left wine to chase my dream of being a musician and continued exploring software development by co-founding a design and tech agency.
